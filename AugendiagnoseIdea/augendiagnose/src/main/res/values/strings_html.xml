<h2>Eye Diagnosis - Overview</h2>

	
	This App has the purpose to support the visualization of eye photographs on an Android device, in order to do medical
	diagnosis.

<h3>Key Features</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Organization of eye photos by name, date and side (right/left)</li>

	<li>Display of two eye photos in parallel (with full support of individual resizing), so that comparisons are possible
		(such as right-left comparison, earlier-later comparison, different person comparison, or comparison to an iris
		topography).</li>

	<li>Change of brightness and contrast of the photo during display, and overlay with an iris topography.</li>

	<li>You can also save information in the photos, such as brightness adaptions and comments. To be able to store
		information and use the full functionality of the app, you need photos in JPG format.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Main activities</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Organize the photos.</h4>

<p>In this step, you can organize eye photos.</p>

<p>The App expects new eye photos in an input folder. This folder is preconfigured as the target folder of the Eye-Fi
	app or as the default folder of the camera, but can be changed via the settings.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Organize new photos&rdquo; activity, you can assign new eye photos from the input folder to a person
	and a date and prepare them in this way for the app. Then the photos will be renamed and moved to the eye photo folder.</p>

<p>
	As further alternative, you may take pictures directly from the app with the device camera. This will normally not give
	photos in adequate quality, but it serves as an alternative to a professional camera, in particular if you use a macro
	lens such as the
	<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/irisocamera/home/english/miniris-eng" target="_blank">Miniris-2</a>
	or
	<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/irisocamera/home/english/iricell-eng" target="_blank">Iricell</a>
	.
</p>

<p>As third alternative,</p>

<h4>Step 2: View photos.</h4>

<p>This is the main purpose of the app, but it requires the photos to be organized via step 1.</p>

<p>In this activity, you can</p>

<ul>
	<li>Show one of the photos in detail. Here you can also change brightness and contrast of the photo, show iris
		topographies as overlay, or write a comment to a photo.</li>

	<li>Display two photos for comparison (and pinch them independently).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Trial period / In-App purchases</h3>

<p>The app allows free use only for a trial period of two weeks. Further use requires the one-time purchase of an in-app
	package.</p>

<h3>Windows application</h3>

<p>
	There is an accompanying Windows application that can be used to view the photos that have been organized with this
	app. For more information, see
	<a href="https://augendiagnose-app.de/en/windowsapp/">https://augendiagnose-app.de/en/windowsapp/</a>
	.
</p>

<h3>Data storage</h3>

<p>The app stores information (like iris position or comments) directly in the JPG image files. This has the advantage
	that all such information is still available if you copy the pictures from one device to another one. To some extent,
	information like comments will be even available when viewing the files in MS Windows.</p>

<p>However, this kind of storage imposes a small risk. It may happen that on some devices, or for pictures from some
	cameras, storage of information in the JPG fails, or possibly even destroys the JPG file. Therefore, it is recommended
	that you keep backups of your JPG files at least when using the app for the first time with a new device or with a new
	camera.</p>


<a name="privacy"></a>
<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>
		The app &ldquo;Eye Diagnosis&rdquo; uses the camera for taking eye photos. The app does not store, collect or send any personal data of any kind.
		All pictures taken by the app are stored only locally on your device.

<h2>Settings</h2>

The application allows the following settings:
<h3>Input Settings</h3>

<table width="100%" border="1">
	<tr>
		<td width="30%" valign="top">Input folder for new eye photos</td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">
			<p>This is the folder, from which the app imports new eye photos. By default, this is either the target folder of the
				Eye-Fi app or the standard folder of the Camera app. However, you can configure here any other folder.</p>

			<p>Background regarding the Eye-Fi app: typically, the camera of the mobile device is not sufficient to capture eye
				photos in high quality. A more practical approach is to use an external camera with Eye-Fi SD card, which transfers
				the photos via WLAN to the mobile device.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="30%" valign="top">Last photo is right eye</td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can define if the last photo is the right or the left eye. By default this is
			the left eye (which means that you made first a photo of the right eye and then of the left eye).</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3>Display Settings</h3>

<table width="100%" border="1">
	<tr>
		<td width="30%" valign="top">Sort by last name</td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you may decide that names are not ordered strictly alphabetically as given, but by
			the last name.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="30%" valign="top">Guided setup of iris and pupil position</td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you may decide if you are guided through setting the iris and pupil position before
			you can display overlays.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="30%" valign="top">Default overlay color</td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can define the default color for iris topography overlays. (Standard: red)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="30%" valign="top">Language</td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can change the language in which the app is displayed. A value change forces a
			restart of the app.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="30%" valign="top">Display all hints</td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can re-enable all hints.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

<h3>Storage and Memory Settings</h3>

<table width="100%" border="1">
	<tr>
		<td width="30%" valign="top">Eye Photo Folder</td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top"><p>This is the folder in which the app manages the eye photos. Normally, you need not
				change this. From here, you can copy the photos to other devices.</p>

			<p>The predefined folder is &ldquo;EyePhotos&rdquo;.</p>

			<p>You can select here a folder either on your device memory or on an SD card. In Android 4.4 (Kitkat), storage on SD
				card has some limitations, therefore some operations will take longer. In Android 5, when selecting a folder on SD
				card, you will have to grant access rights to the SD card via Android&apos;s Storage Access Framework.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="30%" valign="top">Max Bitmap size</td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">This is the size to which photos are scaled down before displaying. This downscaling is
			required to save device memory. The default value is 2048. In devices with little memory, it may be required to
			configure a smaller value (such as 1024). Too big values may crash the application.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="30%" valign="top">Show image in full resolution</td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can decide under which circumstances the photo is displayed in full resolution,
			which allows to see more details on the photo, but consumes memory and computing time.

			<ul>
				<li><b>Always load automatically:</b> The app always stores the photos in full resolution in memory. This gives the
					best user experience on high end devices, but may lead to crashes if there is not enough memory available.</li>

				<li><b>Load automatically when displaying single photo:</b> The app shows full resolution only when displaying a
					single image. This requires half of the memory.</li>

				<li><b>Load only on demand:</b> The app does not show the image in full resolution. This requires least memory and
					CPU, but details in the photo may be lost. The &ldquo;magnifier&rdquo; button <img src="../drawable/ic_clarity.png" />
					allows to display the current picture detail in full resolution.</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="30%" valign="top">Save additional data in jpeg</td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can limit the storage of data in the JPG files by the app.

			<ul>
				<li><b>Store in EXIF (recommended):</b> The app stores relevant information in the JPG file, even in standard fields
					which are visible in Windows.</li>

				<li><b>Store in custom fields:</b> The app stores information in the JPG file, but only in separate fields. Standard
					fields remain unchanged; the data exchange with Windows is not possible.</li>

				<li><b>Don&apos;t store data in images:</b> The app does not store information in JPG files. (This limits the
					functionality of the app.)</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="30%" valign="top">Automatic detection of iris</td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can select if the app should automatically try to find the position of iris and
			pupil in the eye photos. This typically will simplify the positioning of overlays, but it requires many resources of
			the phone, and the result may be incorrect.</td>

<h3>Camera Settings</h3>

<table width="100%" border="1">
		<tr>
		<td width="30%" valign="top">Camera compatibility</td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">If your device runs on Android 5 or higher, then here you can select if the camera
			functionality should use the new Android 5 features or not. Selection of &ldquo;Android 4&rdquo; makes sense in case
			of issues with Android 5 compatibility.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="30%" valign="top">Enable flash</td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you may enable the flashlight functionality. By default, this is disabled, as it is
			dangerous to use the flashlight close to the eye.</td>

<h2>Organize the photos</h2>

<p>Here you can organize your eye photos.</p>

<p>The two last images of the input folder are displayed.</p>

<p>With the button &ldquo;Switch&rdquo; you can exchange the two photos.</p>

<p>With the button &ldquo;Other Photos&rdquo;, you can select one or two different photos from the input folder, by
	clicking on two of the displayed photos. Here, you may also delete photos from the input folder, by using the context
	menu (long click on a photo).</p>

<p>At &ldquo;Select Name&rdquo; you can set the name of the person from which the eye photos are taken. Here you can
	either select an existing name or enter a new name.</p>

<p>At &ldquo;Select Date&rdquo; you can select the date on which the photos are listed. Typically this is the capture
	date of the photos, which is preselected. However, you may select a different date. This is necessary in particular, if
	you want to keep more than one eye pair of a person from one date - the app allows only one photo pair per day and
	person.</p>

<p>With the button &ldquo;OK&rdquo; you can move the selected eye photo pair to the eye photo folder. The photos are
	attached to the given name and date and can then be used by the app.</p>

<p>By tapping on the pair of photos, you can view the two photos in detail. (See also &ldquo;View photos&rdquo;</p>

<h2>View photos</h2>

<p>Here you can select the name of a person whose eye photos you want to see. Then you get shown all eye photos of this
	person in a list sorted by date.</p>

<p>Then you have the following possibilities:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Show one of the photos in detail (via click on a photo).</li>

	<li>Show both photos of one date (via click on a date)</li>

	<li>Show two photos of different dates (via long click on one photo and click on a second photo)</li>

	<li>Show two photos of different persons: Select one photo of this person (via long click) and then select a photo of a
		different person.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that iris topography graphics may be organized just like eye photos - this allows to compare eye photos with
	iris topography graphics. Such graphics are not included in the app (except as overlays).</p>

<h3>Further options in the overview</h3>

<ul>
	<li>When making a long click on a name in the list of names, you may change or delete the name</li>

	<li>When making a long click on a date in the list of pictures for a name, you may change the date or delete the
			pictures of that date, or you may
						move these pictures back to the input folder (e.g. in order to move them to a different name).
					</li>
</ul>

<h3>Further options in the detail view</h3>

<p>In the detail view (one or two photos), you have the following further possibilities:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Change of brightness and contrast via sliders <img src="../drawable/ic_seek_brightness.png" /><img
		src="../drawable/ic_seek_contrast.png" />, as well as change of saturation <img
		src="../drawable/ic_seek_saturation.png" /> and color temperature <img src="../drawable/ic_seek_color_temperature.png" /></li>

	<li>Rotation of the photo (button <img src="../drawable/ic_btn_rotate.png" class="frameless" />)
	</li>

	<li>
		<p>
			Display of iris topographies as overlay (circle button <img src="../drawable/ic_btn_wheel.png" class="frameless" />
			and numbered buttons), adaption of the overlay to the iris and storage of overlay position (lock button <img
				src="../drawable/ic_lock_open.png" />)
		</p>
		<p>When making a long click on one of the numbered buttons, you can change the overlay for this button. For the last
			numbered button, this allows you also to remove the button or add another button.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Set the pupil size for the overlays (button <img src="../drawable/ic_btn_pupil_0.png" class="frameless" />). Here
		you can either keep the pupil centered (<img src="../drawable/ic_btn_pupil_1.png" class="frameless" />) or move it
		freely (<img src="../drawable/ic_btn_pupil_2.png" class="frameless" />).
	</li>

	<li>Store the selected settings of brightness and contrast (via &ldquo;save&rdquo; <img
		src="../drawable/ic_action_save.png" /> button on action bar)
	</li>

	<li>Store the position and zoom (via &ldquo;save&rdquo; <img src="../drawable/ic_action_save.png" /> button on action
		bar)
	</li>

	<li>Share the image (via &ldquo;share&rdquo; <img src="../drawable/ic_action_share.png" /> button on action bar)
	</li>

	<li>Change the comment of the photo (via &ldquo;document&rdquo; <img src="../drawable/ic_comment.png" /> button on
		action bar)
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	These features may be enabled or disabled via the button &ldquo;Show/Hide utilities&rdquo; (<img
		src="../drawable/ic_tools_up.png" /> <img src="../drawable/ic_tools_down.png" /> <img
		src="../drawable/ic_tools_left.png" /> <img src="../drawable/ic_tools_right.png" />).
